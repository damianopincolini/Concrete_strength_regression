Concrete Strength Prediction with R: A Machine Learning Workflow for Compressive Strength Regression

The goal of this project is to find out an efficient regression model trained and tested on a dataset available on Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/regression-with-neural-networking).

Beside this, I've set a couple of more specific aims:
1.  evaluate the impact of applying preprocessing steps either to every variable or to a limited group of them,
2.  optimizing data visualization in order to increase the overall readability of the document.
As far as point 1 is concerned, the main focus is on usage of the workflow_set package, while for second point patchwork and kableExtra packages are involved.
To keep the whole process fast and fluent, I haven't used a wide set of engines since the main focus was on how to manage preprocessing data visualization.
